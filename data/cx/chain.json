      "description": "The CX Chain L1 powers a new frontier in on-chain gaming, purpose-built on Avalanche to merge game execution, liquidity, and fairness into a single decentralized layer. By removing intermediaries and embedding audited randomness and automated payouts directly into the protocol, CX Chain enables a trustless environment where anyone can become a house, delegate capital, or launch games. With native staking, community ownership, and a growing suite of smart-contract games, CX Chain redefines what it means to play, build, and earn in Web3—making liquidity, not just gameplay, a core part of the experience.",
